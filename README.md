# Bike-Share-Analysis

## BACKGROUND
Founded in 2016, Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. In addition to offering traditional bikes, the company also has reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes included in its renting options. They can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Cyclistic has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders while customers who purchase annual memberships are known as members.

The company's finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps the company attract more customers, Lily Moreno – Cyclistic's marketing director – believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Instead of creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.

## BUSINESS TASK
Analyzing the company’s historical bike trip data to identify trends into how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
